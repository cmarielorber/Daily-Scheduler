# Daily-Scheduler
Week 5 Homework-Third Party API's



## Description
Refactoring weeek. This week we were to instruct a daily calendar app which allows it's user to save eents for each hour of a work day. CSS was powered by jQuery and moment library was imported for date/time.
Although I am still trying to understand where it all goes, and the differences between jQuery and Vanilla JS...it's functional.
